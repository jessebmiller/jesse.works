## Problem Statement

Existing static site generators either prioritize developer experience at the cost of performance, or optimize for speed but offer poor extensibility. Large sites with thousands of pages face increasingly slow build times, hampering productivity and deployment frequency.

## Approach

We took a dual approach: developing a high-performance core in Rust while ensuring an approachable extension API for JavaScript developers. The architecture focused on intelligent parallelization, aggressive caching, and incremental regeneration.

A key innovation was our "content graph" implementation, which tracks dependencies between content, templates, and assets to minimize unnecessary work during rebuilds.

## Technologies Used

- Rust for the core processing engine
- WebAssembly for browser-based previews
- Custom template compiler with incremental evaluation
- Content pipeline with pluggable transformers
- Virtual file system for cross-platform consistency

## Outcome and Impact

The resulting tool achieved impressive performance metrics:

- 15x faster build times compared to leading alternatives
- Near-instantaneous hot reloading even for complex sites
- 90% smaller memory footprint
- First meaningful paint in under 15ms for development mode

The project has gained traction in the developer community, with over 2,000 GitHub stars and a growing ecosystem of plugins.
