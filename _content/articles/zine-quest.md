# How I Published City of Blood and Plaster

Early in 2024, I was starting to get pretty involved in a local gaming
group that would come to be known as, Storygames Chicago. Around that
time, Sean Nittner did [an interview about how Evil Hat does
publishing on Third Floor Wars: Tabletop
Talk](https://thirdfloorwars.com/sean-nitner-evil-hat-productions-interview/comment-page-1/).
This interview inspired me to invite folks from Storygames Chicago to
write a zine together and enter it into [Kickstarter's
ZineQuest](https://www.kickstarter.com/zinequest). Amazingly 5
fantastic co-authors joined me and we agreed to work together on the
project. At the beginning, I felt like I was taking a big risk in
coordinating 6 authors who had never worked on a project together when
I had ever either published anything or run a Kickstarter campaign. I
felt like I was risking getting in over my head and then being
responsible to folks who had paid me to deliver something I couldn't
deliver. I'm guessing that there are a lot of people out there who
either have been in this position or will be in this position who
could benefit from hearing how it went for me, someone who met that
risk with impulsivity and decided to do it and figure it out along the
way.

Here's how it went.

## Initial Discussions

Most of us were at the time playing a bunch of Carved from Brindlewood
games, and suspected that the format of their mysteries would be
useful as either prep or prep inspiration for any system. I had also
just stumbled upon this article on [the 7-3-1 prep
technique](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/the-7-3-1-technique) by
the Jason Cordova, author of Brindlewood Bay. We decided to use these
techniques to write a zine full of factions, characters, and mysteries
in this style.

Many of us are interested in Chicago History and the World's Fairs
(1893 and 1933) and decided that it would be best to start with the
classic. So the idea came together. We would write system agnostic
setting material for Gothic horror at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair in
the 7-3-1 and Carved from Brindlewood style.

Then we spent longer than was comfortable workshopping names until we
finally settled on City of Blood and Plaster.

These initial discussionsn happened almost completely on Discord.

## Kickstarter Campaign

I loosely followed this guide after googling "how to do zinequest".
https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2021/10/how-to-do-zinequest-step-by-step-guide.html

We were not ready at the start of zinequest, which runs during the
month of February, but did get the campaign description written, with
descriptions of the materials and mysteries we'd be writing, in time
for the last half of the month.

When I created the kickstarter campaign, I put the goal extremely low
so we'd essentially be guaranteed to be funded. I was able to do this
because we were all doing it for the fun and experience and were
willing to use creative commons art. We had zero up front cost, and
with DTRPG and print on demand we were able to be very confident that
we'd be able to fulfill no matter how few or how many backers we got.

I did some spreadsheet work to figure out how to price the tiers based
on costs at DTRPG using this site to price the book (at an estimated
32 pages) https://www.drivethrurpg.com/pub_pod_cost.php

I looked at other zines comperable to the one we were planning to
write and mainly did this math to confirm that those prices had very
low risk for us.

 Printing cost (32 pages)
 $ 2.68


 Reward 	 Price 	 Fees 	 Available 	 Less printing
 PDF 	 $ 5.00 	 $ 0.55 	 $ 4.45 	 $ 4.45
 Print + PDF 	 $ 15.00 	 $ 1.40 	 $ 13.60 	 $ 10.92


 Potential goals
backers	all PDF	all print+pdf
17	 $ 85.00 	 $ 255.00
		 $ 45.56
		209.44
		82.13%

When setting up the campaign, I saw that there was an option for
collecting shipping fees and I referenced this page
https://help.drivethrurpg.com/hc/en-us/articles/12723268748055-Estimated-Shipping-Costs
to figure out what a safe US and International shipping cost would be.

I noticed that the campaign didn't have the zinequest tag so I googled
"how to get zinequest tag kickstarter" and found the answer which was
to use a link that I had not used.

So I sent a request to support here.
https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
title: Can I get the Zine Quest tag for City of Blood and Plaster?
request: I created my project without going through the link that puts
me in Zine Quest. Can you help me get my campaign included in Zine
Quest this month?

They added the tag very quickly

## Writing, Editing, Art, and Layout

We each went off and wrote our sections in Google docs, sharing
progress as we went and incorporating each others work where we
could. We wanted the zine to be cohesive and intertwined so we
discussed as we went and each wrote with the knowledge if what the
others were working on. We edited each others writing as well as we
could (some of us are more experienced at that than others.)

I'm a linux user and I'm not super interested in figuring out how to
use Adobe InDesign or Affinity Publisher on linux so I used
[Scribus](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scribus/) for layout, and
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for art. Both are clunky as most free
and open source software is, but they did the job just fine and had
helpful enough documentation. I was learning both pretty much from
nothing as I went.

One of us found a tweet
https://x.com/riseupcomus/status/1770782416384188470 reccomending cook
books as reference for RPG book layout. I found a few old cook books
with layout that felt 1800s old timey and used them as inspiration.

I looked at fonts that were popular and released around the time on
this site http://www.identifont.com/year?1893 to get an idea of their
typographic style. Then browsed [Google
fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for fonts that read similar to me. I
found EB Garamond there, and Didot by browsing "fonts by similarity"
at Identifont.

## Fulfillment

Print on demand and specifically Drive Thru RPG made this feasible to do.

* created products (set up a new title) here https://www.drivethrurpg.com/pub_tools.php
* It's clunky and needed persistence
* Downloaded templates to prepare book cover image. https://www.drivethrurpg.com/pub_podbook_templates.php
* Uploaded cover PDF (a mock at first to confirm I understood how to use the template without spending much time on the art)
* Uploaded a content PDF
* Error on the content PDF, needed to add specific bleed values. Googled how to do that in Scribus, uploaded a new PDF
* Waited a few days for the files to be sent to the printer
* Ordered a proof with the mock cover ($19.75) (took some time to arrive, I expect that the first printing of a file takes longer)
* Reviewed the proof for changes. Noted uncentered images, typos, awkward layout.
