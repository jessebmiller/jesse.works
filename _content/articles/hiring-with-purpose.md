# Hiring with Purpose

As I've been job hunting, I’ve encountered a wide range of recruitment
strategies and techniques, but none as exciting as Clipboard Health's
approach.

They’re not accepting the status quo of hiring based on resumes and
interviews. Instead, they’ve deliberately decided on the outcomes they
want from their hiring process and designed a system to achieve those
outcomes. The result is a process that looks a little different from a
typical application experience, and for me, it’s been refreshing.

Clipboard Health outlines their evolving hiring process for their
product team in this article: https://lnkd.in/gpw8A4nH

When I hire, I focus on two key questions:

1. How well can the candidate and the team communicate?
2. Will the candidate learn and grow professionally on the team?

A candidate's ability to perform a specific task on day one is
secondary to me. If we can communicate well and they can grow on our
team, they'll be a good hire.

What I’ve experienced and read so far of Clipboard Health’s hiring
process feels like they genuinely prioritize finding good fits over
simply filling static job descriptions. I'm genuinely interested, as
an applicant, in learning if this is a good fit for me, in learning
how well we communicate, and in learning if I'll be able to grow on
their team. In contrast, for many other companies I feel as though I'm
trying to pass a test.

Their writing on their recruiting process inspired me to explore their
writing on other subjects, and I’ve become a genuine fan. When I think
of companies with methodologies worth emulating, a few come to mind:

* **3M**, for their grounding in original scientific research and
    internal publication processes.
* **Toyota**, for their "just-in-time" manufacturing, continuous
    improvement, stop-the-line culture, and respect for workers.
* **Clipboard Health**, for hiring with a focus on cultural fit,
    competing on the speed of solving customer problems, and exuding
    clarity.

Clipboard Health has challenged me to think about how I can be this
deliberate and thoughtful in designing other parts of my life—both
personal and professional. Thanks for setting the example, Clipboard
Health.
