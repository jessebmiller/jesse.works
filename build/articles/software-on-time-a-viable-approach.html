  <h1>Software on Time, A Viable Approach</h1>
<p>I've got a lot of experience delivering projects on time. These were
theater productions not software products but there are plenty of
lessions that can be learned from that experience.</p>
<p>I've also got a lot of experience with continuously sliding deadlines
and esitmates for software development and after 8 years in theatrical
production and more than 10 years in software development and
leadership I've got some insights to share.</p>
<p>Something everyone unerstands in theater is that &quot;the show must go
on.&quot; Tickets have been sold. People are showing up. We've got to give
them something to see. The opening night deadline in theater
productions is more strict and important than any deadline I've
encountered in software product development. It's almost like the
software world has accepted that it's impossible to expect and in some
cases has given up on trying to do it.</p>
<p>--- is this a different article? ---</p>
<p>In most cases this is the right thing to do. The deadlines that I've
seen in software development have largely been self imposed and are
there to give leadership a sense of control and the ability to see
that progress is being made. These are often represented as a roadmap
with dates attached. Either in the form of a sprint (we'll get these
done this week) or a larger querterly or yearly roadmap (this is what
we need to get done this quarter).</p>
<p>As Marty Cagen says in &quot;Inspired&quot; (which you should read if you are in
tech leadership, even if you aren't in product specifically) these
roadmaps are used for two main reasons. To make sure the important
thigns are getting done first, and to make time sensitive business
plans and committments.</p>
<p>The first goal doesn't need a deadline to achieve. It just needs for
the items to be sorted in priority order, that said, and perhaps there
is another article here, priority or value does often depend on how
fast something can get done. Value is benefit/cost, which includes
time. But whatever, lean methods, kanban, continuous discovery,
contunuous delivery works very well in these conditions. No deadlines
needed.</p>
<p>Strict deadline, strict scope, innovation pick two (or scope is a
variable we can learn to be flexible with to help be on time and on
budget more often in software projects)</p>
<p>Software development is more like theater production than it is like
manufacturing. The output is something new that's never been delivered
before.</p>
<p>Evidence: manufacturing is the work involved in reliably duplicating
and delivering physical objects or materials which is subject to
constraints that don't apply to the development of new software
products and features. Lessons from manufacturing more directly apply
to software operations (SRE, DevOps) than to development (new
features, product innovation). Duplication of existing software has a
cost of zero. Therefore all software development is stuff the
developer hasn't seen before and must figure out how to do. That's the
work, and the simplicity of the problem does not reliably map to a
simplicity of a solution. rsync is a great example of this. Simple
idea, dont' send everything, just changes. It would be easy to think
that this would not be sufficiently complex for a PHD thesis but it
turns out it is.</p>
<p>Set deadlines with plenty of time to get a minimum acceptable scope,
then plenty of time to iterate and make it as good as you can for as
long as you have.</p>
